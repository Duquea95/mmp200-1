  <header><h1>Learning to Live With Urban Coyotes</h1></header>
  <div id="content">
    <div class="left-col"><p>Only a few decades ago, Wile E. Coyote in hapless pursuit of Road Runner may have been the most readily conjured image of Canis latrans, the coyote, for most city dwellers. But increasingly, residents of urban and suburban areas are having firsthand experience with coyotes in their own yards, parks and neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Coyotes now inhabit every state in the country except Hawaii, eating mostly rodents, rabbits, and fruit while making their homes between apartment buildings and in industrial parks and popular recreation areas in metropolitan areas from New York City to Chicago to San Francisco. Recent research suggests that coyotes could prove to be just the first of a wave of larger carnivores — bears, cougars, and wolves — moving into residential areas.</p>
<p>“There’s a number of things that coyotes really find to their liking in suburban communities, more than adjacent wild areas,” said Robert Timm, a wildlife specialist and the director of the University of California’s Hopland Research and Extension Center. Food set out continually for a pet or stray cat, fallen fruit left in the yard, a small dog running off-leash or a cat allowed to wander the neighborhood, a bird feeder stocked year-round — all of these things can attract coyotes.</p>
</div>
    <div class="center-col"><p>“It may only take one person feeding coyotes to develop a really aggressive one,” Mr. Timm said in a phone interview. “If some people are just ignoring them and coyotes are finding a lot of resources, they can start to think, ‘Oh, this is a really good place to be. I own this neighborhood now.’”</p>
<p>
A bold coyote that lacks a natural wariness of humans can be a problematic one. But according to Camilla Fox, founder and executive director of Project Coyote, an organization based in Larkspur, Calif., that seeks to promote appreciation of coyotes and minimize lethal control, the animals’ behavior is often misinterpreted. “I may see a coyote in my neighborhood, and recognize that coyote is moving through, looking for a mate,” she said. “A neighbor might say that coyote is a danger.”
</p><p>
Founded in 2008, Project Coyote works with communities to develop “coexistence plans” that focus on strategic hazing, or training residents, animal control officers and parks staff to use consistent and persistent deterrents like loud noises, water spraying, bright lights, throwing objects, shouting and chasing coyotes.</p></div>
    <div class="right-col"><p>Denver adopted a hazing-based management plan three years ago, sending out teams, for example, to scare off coyotes that had taken to trotting after joggers in a public park. And according to a case study prepared by wildlife specialists with the Humane Society of the United States and Denver’s Parks and Recreation Department, officials report that hazing has successfully reversed “aggressive and undesirable behaviors in coyote family groups and solitary coyotes, reduching pet attacks in neighborhoods and reducing the overall number of complaints from residents.”</p>
<p>
In Denver, the killing of coyotes was reserved as a last resort — an action to be taken only in response to human attacks — but no lethal control has been used since the hazing program began in 2009. According to the case study, “one of the novel and cost-savings aspects of the program is its hands-on and empowering nature — it gives local residents the ability and confidence to address coyote conflicts in their own backyards, without outside help.” Similar programs are being developed or put into effect around the country.
</p><p>
Ms. Fox said that education was crucial. “Whether it’s coyotes, mountain lions, or bears, in urban areas — particularly when law enforcement are the first responders — they may dispatch an animal, kill an animal that didn’t necessarily need to be killed, wasn’t necessarily a public safety threat and simply needed to be hazed away.”</p></div>
