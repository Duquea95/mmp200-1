- FreeNYC
- Quick Dinner
- CUNY Design Programs

### Stage 1: Definition

Define target audience group. You must have at least two!
Develop specific project requirements – write a project brief.
Write a persona for each target audience group.
Stage 2: Information Architecture

Based on your scenarios, and what you learned about your target audiences’ needs, organize the content into pages, label the pages, and design navigation bars. Represent the site’s structure and navigation bar in a  sitemap.

Deliverable: Sitemap

Stage 3. Prototype and Assess

Sketch interfaces for key pages foe desktop and mobile. Prototype with Bootstrap.

Deliverables: sketches, prototype. Class presentations of prototypes.

Stage 4. Visual Design

Design the look and feel of the website. Your design choices must include:

Colors and textures
Typographic design (fonts, font sizes, font weights, leading, etc.)
Responsive Layout
Imagery
Page elements, such as header, navigation and footer
Create a style tile that showcases your design vision. You can start with the expert style tile template(PSD) or with a simplified version (Illustrator).
