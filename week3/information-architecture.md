[The Information Architecture Institute](http://iainstitute.org/) defines information architecture as

“the art and science of organizing andlabeling websites, intranets, online communities and software to support usability.”

Information Architecture work consists of:

- Defining website goals and target audiences.
- Identify content and functional requirements.
- Grouping and categorizing content
- Labeling content
- Designing navigation systems
  
Grouping and categorizing content
-------------------------

  - **Exact organizational schemes:** alphabetical, chronological, geographical
  - **Ambiguous organizational schemes:** topic, task, audience, metaphor, hybrid

**challenges**
- Ambiguity: we use language used to classify and label content, and language is often ambiguous.
- Heterogeneity: a website consists of content of different types and forms.
- Difference in perspective: Labeling and classifying are affected by personal perspectives
- Internal politics
