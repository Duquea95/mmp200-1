title: Block-Level Vs. Inline elements
---

Block-level elements define blocks of content in the page and by default always start in a new line. Examples of block level elements are paragraphs, lists, headings and div elements.

Inline elements define sections within the block-level elements and by default continue the line of the parent element.

It is important to distinguish between block-level and inline tags, particularly as some CSS properties behave differently when applied to block-level and inline elements.
